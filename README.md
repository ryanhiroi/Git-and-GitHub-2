# Second time push file to github by using git. I found a faster and better way so I'll use these steps in the future.
## Steps that I do:

1. Open source control on VS code.
2. Commit file, push file and sync file by clicking on there.


## Small update: 
I also try git clone and sync my edit from MacBook to my pc so it's very convinient. Also, I tryna find a way to delete the .DS_Store file on Mac because it's kinda annoying.
